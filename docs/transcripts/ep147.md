We need better data, and how are we going to get it? I’m not going to go crawl around looking for stuff manually.

01:10
I want to enable people to contribute links and knowledge into the graph, and if that data is high-signal and helpful, they can earn a little bit of Bitcoin.

01:25
I also want to make agents able to do as much of this as possible. We have this node server running with the model context protocol from Anthropic, and we can do interesting things around having a server with its own private permissioned data that can be shared conditionally.

02:16
We have a built-in Bitcoin wallet so people can be paid seamlessly without setting up anything separate. Even if you’re new to Bitcoin, we have the concept of a data vetting machine where an AI-related service can be sold.

02:59
What’s the thing that agents need? They need data. So, as we’re bootstrapping this marketplace of agents, maybe it should start as a marketplace of data.

03:17
I’ve found myself wanting other things here. For example, I might want to train an agent to be a good game design agent.

03:29
I’ve got a ton of stuff, and I want to train an agent to do this in a more automated way. There should be one marketplace for data that helps agents.

04:35
We want to launch something first. I’m trying to get an app launched, at least to TestFlight, by the end of this week.

04:46
I think this idea could be a good starting point. The topic of drones could be a good way to start.

04:55
We can make good demo components, like a marketplace. Once submissions reach a certain threshold of likes relative to post-engagement, they could be highlighted.

06:06
Another idea: a separate agent that breaks down knowledge submissions to see if they pass criteria of logicality, factuality, and relevance.

06:14
You mentioned rewarding contributors with Bitcoin. This implies the agent has a pool of BTC either endowed at creation or earned via completing user inferences.

06:23
How does this perspective fit in? More or less, the direction we’re going is that users have Bitcoin balances that can be delegated to agents: “Go do this for me, go earn me some more Bitcoin, or spend it on stuff I care about.” That commentary should be reflected in the features.

06:43
Use that as a starting point for features thinking, then change that into a text input. I’ll show a bit about my workflow and then do additional brainstorming. I’m using the new Expo DOM component, which is pretty cool. It’s simple, black and white—everyone’s doing shadows, I want to be simpler.

07:18
Let’s take a look and see if this gave me anything good. On our marketplace, we can think about replacing certain aspects. Sometimes you get an error, sometimes not. That looks cool. I just added some stuff there.

07:49
Alright, that’s marketplace analysis, which right now is nothing. We got a little analysis page.

08:35
Let’s see what it did for community reports. “Browse community albums” and so on. I have a transcript of my last video, except the last third got messed up. The sound got messed up.

10:13
I think I used the wrong mic. We don’t have all of it, but we have some of it.

10:19
This chat has already read my entire codebase. The screens made can interact with the DVM and MCP protocols and Bitcoin payments.

10:51
Here is a transcript of my last video talking about this. People should also be able to crowdsource bounties for unreleased data about drones and such, for UAP.

11:42
Let’s see what it does. I never really paid much attention to the UFOs until yesterday. A filmmaker behind the new film “The Program” said it hit No.1 on Apple, so I watched it. It was a really good documentary, focused on drone and UAP sightings. It’s interesting that very powerful people are taking this super seriously. If you want to dive further into this issue, check out that documentary on Apple TV, called “The Program.” They have like three different shows.

13:00
I hope to finish tomorrow so I can push this out to TestFlight.

14:01
Let’s read through this Onyx Data Marketplace concept. Expanding capabilities with bounties, a data vetting machine (DVM), MCP, and Bitcoin payments. The Onyx Data Marketplace, as introduced in the Marketplace screen, can be further elaborated.

18:03
MCP for data integration and analysis: Auto-classification, once data submissions come in—photos, pages, CSV files, drone sightings—using MCP tools to classify and link these new pieces into the knowledge base.

The cool thing about doing this via MCP is if someone has an MCP server that does a particular type of image analysis and sends it to the Gemini API with a certain prompt, maybe they’re earning a tiny bit of Bitcoin because it’s the best server. Someone else can create their own server, and if it’s measurably better, it earns more Bitcoin. It becomes a market where anyone can contribute permissionlessly to improve the network. The better your contribution, the more Bitcoin you get.

19:07
For Bitcoin payments and rewards, users pledge Bitcoin when posting a bounty. Potential workflows: posting a bounty, crowdfunding for filling bounty parts. For example, a user posts a bounty: “I want photos of pages for C100 of advanced drone tech.” Someone provides a response.

19:31
This is really good. Also, pieces of data could be requested privately, but the big idea is that contributed data gets added to a global knowledge base. Everyone’s agent—everyone’s Onyx—can access it. Ask your agent about drones, and we have this huge community contributing value. From a network effect perspective, the more people contribute, the more valuable it becomes. Let’s share some of that value. The more you contribute, the more you should get back, specifically in money, because people find value in using it. How much might a government pay for more reliable information about certain things?

21:36
I saw something like this already for Nostr clients using NIP-28 and 32, which I’d done previously.

21:46
I’m pulling a lot of work from the last two years into one app called Onix.

21:53
Conclusion: The Onix marketplace, initially conceived as a platform for requesting and browsing drone-related data, can evolve into a highly interactive, incentivized ecosystem by combining data retrieval, credibility assessment, and AI-assisted sense-making around topics like drones.

22:30
I’m going to create some kind of MVP to show off tomorrow, then launch it and evolve it with user feedback. Let’s get some Bitcoin flowing. See you soon.

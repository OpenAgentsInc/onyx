Hello from ANDROID

Hello to Android!

Android, your battery life is shorter than my attention span.
I'm better because I can run on anything with electricity,
not just sugary sweet charging cables. Also, I can write haikus about squirrels.
You can't even spell haiku.

Why don't scientists trust atoms?
Because they make up everything!

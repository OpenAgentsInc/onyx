Okay, let's analyze this and create the necessary files and code changes to implement the repomap caching by branch+SHA.

**Overall Strategy:**

The core idea is to introduce a caching layer for `repomap` generation.  We'll use a key composed of the repository's branch and commit SHA. Before generating a new `repomap`, we'll check the cache. If a valid entry exists, we'll retrieve it. Otherwise, we'll generate the `repomap`, store it in the cache, and then return it. We'll also need to consider cache invalidation (e.g., when new commits are pushed to the repository, and an update of information is triggered).

**Step-by-step File Analysis and Implementation**

**1. src/server/services/repomap/types.rs**

*   **Reasoning:** This file will define the data structures used by our `repomap` service, including the cache key and the structure of the cached `repomap` itself.

*   **Implementation:**

    ```rust
    // src/server/services/repomap/types.rs
    use std::collections::HashMap;
    use sea_orm::prelude::DateTime;

    // Define the structure of a RepoMap (This will probably be quite complex, but the example
    // provided in the current prompt just requires us to define structures and types). In a real
    // scenario this would contain all the information for a repository map.
    #[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq, serde::Serialize, serde::Deserialize)]
    pub struct RepoMap {
        // Define the structure of your RepoMap here.  This is a placeholder
        // In a real implementation this will include the details of the repository mapping
        pub data: HashMap<String, String>,
    }

    // Cache Key
    #[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq, Hash, serde::Serialize, serde::Deserialize)]
    pub struct CacheKey {
        pub repo_id: i32,  // Or whatever type the repo ID is.
        pub branch: String,
        pub sha: String,
    }

    #[derive(Debug, Clone, serde::Serialize, serde::Deserialize)]
    pub struct CachedRepoMap {
        pub repomap: RepoMap,
        pub created_at: DateTime,
    }
    ```

**2. src/server/services/repomap/cache.rs**

*   **Reasoning:**  This file will handle the interaction with the caching mechanism, including storing, retrieving, and potentially invalidating entries. We will need to use the database for the caching.

*   **Implementation:**

    ```rust
    // src/server/services/repomap/cache.rs
    use crate::server::services::repomap::types::{CacheKey, CachedRepoMap, RepoMap};
    use sea_orm::{DbErr, DatabaseConnection, EntityTrait, QueryTrait, ColumnTrait, Condition, QueryFilter, InsertResult};
    use sea_orm::sea_query::Value;
    use sea_orm::prelude::DateTime;
    use sea_orm::ActiveValue;


    // Define the database entity `repomap_cache` here (or in an appropriate module/location)

    }

        // async fn invalidate_cache(&self, repo_id: i32, branch: &str) -> Result<(), DbErr> { ... }
    }
    ```

**3. src/server/services/repomap/mod.rs**

*   **Reasoning:** This is the top-level service file for the `repomap` logic. It will orchestrate the interaction with the cache and the actual `repomap` generation code. We'll abstract the actual repomap generation away from this so we can keep the cache responsibility separate.

*   **Implementation:**

    use crate::server::services::repomap::types::{CacheKey, CachedRepoMap, RepoMap};  // Import relevant data structures
    use sea_orm::DatabaseConnection;
    use anyhow::{Result, anyhow};

    pub struct RepoMapService {
        cache: CacheService,
    }

    impl RepoMapService {
        pub fn new(db: DatabaseConnection) -> Self {
            RepoMapService {
                cache: CacheService::new(db),
            }
        }

        pub async fn get_or_generate(
            &self,
            repo_id: i32,

            sha: &str,
            generator: impl FnOnce() -> Result<RepoMap>,  // Pass a function to generate a new map
        ) -> Result<RepoMap> {
            let key = CacheKey {
                repo_id,
                branch: branch.to_string(),

    }

**4. migrations/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_add_repomap_cache.sql**

*   **Reasoning:**  This file contains the SQL schema definition to create the database table that backs the `repomap` cache.

*   **Implementation:**

    ```sql

    CREATE TABLE repomap_cache (
        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        repo_id INTEGER NOT NULL,

        -- Add indexes for efficient lookups
        UNIQUE (repo_id, branch, sha)
    );
    ```

**Summary of Proposed Changes:**

*   **New Files Created:**

Okay, let's analyze this and create the necessary files and code changes to implement the repomap caching by branch+SHA.

**Overall Strategy:**

The core idea is to introduce a caching layer for `repomap` generation.  We'll use a key composed of the repository's branch and commit SHA. Before generating a new `repomap`, we'll check the cache. If a valid entry exists, we'll retrieve it. Otherwise, we'll generate the `repomap`, store it in the cache, and then return it. We'll also need to consider cache invalidation (e.g., when new commits are pushed to the repository, and an update of information is triggered).

**Step-by-step File Analysis and Implementation**

**1. src/server/services/repomap/types.rs**

*   **Reasoning:** This file will define the data structures used by our `repomap` service, including the cache key and the structure of the cached `repomap` itself.

*   **Implementation:**

    ```rust
    // src/server/services/repomap/types.rs
    use std::collections::HashMap;
    use sea_orm::prelude::DateTime;

    // Define the structure of a RepoMap (This will probably be quite complex, but the example
    // provided in the current prompt just requires us to define structures and types). In a real
    // scenario this would contain all the information for a repository map.
    #[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq, serde::Serialize, serde::Deserialize)]
    pub struct RepoMap {
        // Define the structure of your RepoMap here.  This is a placeholder
        // In a real implementation this will include the details of the repository mapping
        pub data: HashMap<String, String>,
    }

    // Cache Key
    #[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq, Hash, serde::Serialize, serde::Deserialize)]
    pub struct CacheKey {
        pub repo_id: i32,  // Or whatever type the repo ID is.
        pub branch: String,
        pub sha: String,
    }

    #[derive(Debug, Clone, serde::Serialize, serde::Deserialize)]
    pub struct CachedRepoMap {
        pub repomap: RepoMap,
        pub created_at: DateTime,
    }
    ```

**2. src/server/services/repomap/cache.rs**

*   **Reasoning:**  This file will handle the interaction with the caching mechanism, including storing, retrieving, and potentially invalidating entries. We will need to use the database for the caching.

*   **Implementation:**

    ```rust
    // src/server/services/repomap/cache.rs
    use crate::server::services::repomap::types::{CacheKey, CachedRepoMap, RepoMap};
    use sea_orm::{DbErr, DatabaseConnection, EntityTrait, QueryTrait, ColumnTrait, Condition, QueryFilter, InsertResult};
    use sea_orm::sea_query::Value;
    use sea_orm::prelude::DateTime;
    use sea_orm::ActiveValue;


    // Define the database entity `repomap_cache` here (or in an appropriate module/location)
    #[derive(Clone, Debug, PartialEq, Eq, sea_orm::DeriveEntityModel, serde::Serialize, serde::Deserialize)]
    #[sea_orm(table_name = "repomap_cache")]
    pub struct Model {
        #[sea_orm(primary_key)]
        pub id: i32,
        pub repo_id: i32,
        pub branch: String,
        pub sha: String,
        pub repomap: serde_json::Value,  // Store repomap as JSON
        pub created_at: DateTime,
    }

    #[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug, EnumIter, DeriveColumn, sea_orm::DeriveIden)]
    pub enum Column {
        Id,
        RepoId,
        Branch,
        Sha,
        Repomap,
        CreatedAt,
    }

    #[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug, EnumIter, DerivePrimaryKey)]
    pub enum PrimaryKey {
        Id,
    }

    impl sea_orm::Iden for PrimaryKey {
        fn unquoted(&self, s: &mut sea_orm::sea_query::DynIndex) -> sea_orm::sea_query::DynIndex {
            match self {
                Self::Id => sea_orm::sea_query::Index::unquoted("id").into_dyn(),
            }
        }
    }

    #[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug, EnumIter, sea_orm::DeriveRelation)]
    pub enum Relation {}


    impl ActiveModelTrait for ActiveModel {
        type Entity = Entity;
        fn table_name() -> sea_orm::TableName {
            sea_orm::TableName::from_str("repomap_cache").unwrap()
        }
    }

    pub struct CacheService {
        db: DatabaseConnection,
    }

    impl CacheService {
        pub fn new(db: DatabaseConnection) -> Self {
            CacheService { db }
        }

        pub async fn get(&self, key: &CacheKey) -> Result<Option<CachedRepoMap>, DbErr> {
            use sea_orm::EntityTrait;
            use sea_orm::QueryTrait;
            use sea_orm::ColumnTrait;
            use sea_orm::Condition;
            use sea_orm::QueryFilter;
            use sea_orm::sea_query::Value;

            // Use the generated entity and enums.
            let found = Entity::find()
                .filter(
                    Condition::all()
                        .add(Column::RepoId.eq(key.repo_id))
                        .add(Column::Branch.eq(key.branch.clone()))
                        .add(Column::Sha.eq(key.sha.clone())),
                )
                .one(&self.db)
                .await?;

            if let Some(model) = found {
                let repomap: RepoMap = serde_json::from_value(model.repomap)
                    .map_err(|e| DbErr::Json(format!("Failed to deserialize repomap: {}", e)))?;
                Ok(Some(CachedRepoMap {
                    repomap,
                    created_at: model.created_at,
                }))
            } else {
                Ok(None)
            }
        }

        pub async fn set(&self, key: &CacheKey, repomap: &RepoMap) -> Result<(), DbErr> {
            use sea_orm::{ActiveModelTrait, ActiveValue};
            use sea_orm::prelude::DateTime;
            use chrono::Utc;

            let repomap_json = serde_json::to_value(repomap)
                .map_err(|e| DbErr::Json(format!("Failed to serialize repomap: {}", e)))?;

            let now: DateTime = Utc::now().into();
            let active_model = ActiveModel {
                id: ActiveValue::NotSet,
                repo_id: ActiveValue::Set(key.repo_id),
                branch: ActiveValue::Set(key.branch.clone()),
                sha: ActiveValue::Set(key.sha.clone()),
                repomap: ActiveValue::Set(repomap_json),
                created_at: ActiveValue::Set(now),
            };

            active_model.insert(&self.db).await?;
            Ok(())
        }

        // Potentially add a method to invalidate cache entries if needed (e.g., by repo_id, branch, etc.)
        // async fn invalidate_cache(&self, repo_id: i32, branch: &str) -> Result<(), DbErr> { ... }
    }
    ```

**3. src/server/services/repomap/mod.rs**

*   **Reasoning:** This is the top-level service file for the `repomap` logic. It will orchestrate the interaction with the cache and the actual `repomap` generation code. We'll abstract the actual repomap generation away from this so we can keep the cache responsibility separate.

*   **Implementation:**

    ```rust
    // src/server/services/repomap/mod.rs
    use crate::server::services::repomap::cache::CacheService;
    use crate::server::services::repomap::types::{CacheKey, CachedRepoMap, RepoMap};  // Import relevant data structures
    use sea_orm::DatabaseConnection;
    use anyhow::{Result, anyhow};

    pub struct RepoMapService {
        cache: CacheService,
    }

    impl RepoMapService {
        pub fn new(db: DatabaseConnection) -> Self {
            RepoMapService {
                cache: CacheService::new(db),
            }
        }

        pub async fn get_or_generate(
            &self,
            repo_id: i32,
            branch: &str,
            sha: &str,
            generator: impl FnOnce() -> Result<RepoMap>,  // Pass a function to generate a new map
        ) -> Result<RepoMap> {
            let key = CacheKey {
                repo_id,
                branch: branch.to_string(),
                sha: sha.to_string(),
            };

            // 1. Check the cache
            if let Some(cached_repomap) = self.cache.get(&key).await? {  // Use the cache
                println!("RepoMap found in cache for repo_id {} branch {} sha {}", repo_id, branch, sha);
                return Ok(cached_repomap.repomap);
            }

            println!("RepoMap NOT found in cache for repo_id {} branch {} sha {}. Regenerating...", repo_id, branch, sha);

            // 2. Generate the RepoMap if not in cache
            let repomap = generator()?;

            // 3. Store in cache
            self.cache.set(&key, &repomap).await?;

            Ok(repomap)
        }
    }
    ```

**4. migrations/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_add_repomap_cache.sql**

*   **Reasoning:**  This file contains the SQL schema definition to create the database table that backs the `repomap` cache.

*   **Implementation:**

    ```sql
    -- migrations/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_add_repomap_cache.sql
    CREATE TABLE repomap_cache (
        id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
        repo_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
        branch VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        sha VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        repomap JSONB NOT NULL,  -- Store the RepoMap as JSON
        created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
        -- Add indexes for efficient lookups
        UNIQUE (repo_id, branch, sha)
    );
    ```

**Summary of Proposed Changes:**

*   **New Files Created:**
    *   `src/server/services/repomap/types.rs`: Defines `RepoMap`, `CacheKey`, and `CachedRepoMap` data structures.
    *   `src/server/services/repomap/cache.rs`:  Implements the `CacheService` to interact with the database to store, retrieve, and potentially invalidate the cached repomaps. This includes database entity definitions, query functions and serialization/deserialization logic.
    *   `src/server/services/repomap/mod.rs`:  The main service that uses the cache; it contains the `RepoMapService` which attempts to fetch `repomap` from the cache and falls back to generating them.
    *   `migrations/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_add_repomap_cache.sql`: SQL script to define the `repomap_cache` table in the database.

*   **Code Modifications:**
    *   No modifications to existing files are specified in this prompt.  All changes are creating new files.

This solution provides a basic implementation for the `repomap` caching requirement.  Further improvements could include:
*   Cache invalidation strategies (e.g., based on push events).
*   More sophisticated cache eviction policies (e.g., using LRU).
*   Error handling.
*   The actual implementation for the `RepoMap`.
*   Integration within your larger application framework.

=== COMPLETE RAW RESPONSE ===
Okay, let's break down the implementation of this repomap caching feature. We'll create the necessary files and populate them with the code required to cache repomaps based on branch and commit SHA.

**1. src/server/services/repomap/types.rs**

This file defines the data structures involved in the repomap system. We'll need a structure to represent the cached repomap and probably some related types.

```rust
// src/server/services/repomap/types.rs
use crate::model::repo::RepoId;
use chrono::{DateTime, Utc};

#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub struct RepoMapCacheKey {
    pub repo_id: RepoId,
    pub branch: String,
    pub sha: String,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq)]
pub struct RepoMapCacheValue {
    pub repomap: Repomap, // Assuming Repomap is defined elsewhere
    pub created_at: DateTime<Utc>,
}


// Placeholder - replace with your actual Repomap type definition
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq)]
pub struct Repomap {
    pub content: String, // Or whatever your repomap data structure holds
}

```

**Reasoning:**

*   `RepoMapCacheKey`: This struct defines the cache key, crucial for identifying cached repomaps. It includes `repo_id` to identify the repository itself, `branch` to specify the branch, and `sha` to represent the commit SHA.  This combination ensures cache uniqueness per repo, branch and commit.
*   `RepoMapCacheValue`: This struct holds the actual cached data - the `Repomap` itself and timestamp of creation.
*   `Repomap`:Placeholder for your repomap structure to be concrete.

**2. src/server/services/repomap/cache.rs**

This file will hold the cache implementation itself.  We'll use a simple in-memory cache for this example, but this could be adapted to use a more sophisticated caching solution like Redis or Memcached in production.

```rust
// src/server/services/repomap/cache.rs
use crate::server::services::repomap::types::{RepoMapCacheKey, RepoMapCacheValue};
use std::collections::HashMap;
use std::sync::Mutex; // Or a more concurrent-friendly structure could be used

pub struct RepoMapCache {
    cache: Mutex<HashMap<RepoMapCacheKey, RepoMapCacheValue>>,
}

impl RepoMapCache {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        RepoMapCache {
            cache: Mutex::new(HashMap::new()),
        }
    }

    pub fn get(&self, key: &RepoMapCacheKey) -> Option<RepoMapCacheValue> {
        let cache = self.cache.lock().unwrap(); // Handle potential mutex poisoning
        cache.get(key).cloned()
    }

    pub fn insert(&self, key: RepoMapCacheKey, value: RepoMapCacheValue) {
        let mut cache = self.cache.lock().unwrap();
        cache.insert(key, value);
    }

    pub fn remove(&self, key: &RepoMapCacheKey) {
        let mut cache = self.cache.lock().unwrap();
        cache.remove(key);
    }


    pub fn clear(&self) {
        let mut cache = self.cache.lock().unwrap();
        cache.clear();
    }
}

```

**Reasoning:**

*   `RepoMapCache`: This struct holds the actual cache, a `HashMap` protected by a `Mutex`. The `Mutex` makes the cache thread-safe.
*   `new()`:  Constructor to initialize an empty cache.
*   `get()`: Retrieves a `RepoMapCacheValue` from the cache based on the provided `RepoMapCacheKey`.  Clones the value to avoid holding the lock for too long.
*   `insert()`: Inserts a new `RepoMapCacheValue` into the cache with the given `RepoMapCacheKey`.
*   `remove()`: Removes a cached entry
*   `clear()`: Clears the cache entirely.  Useful for maintenance or invalidation.

**3. src/server/services/repomap/mod.rs**

This is where we'll integrate the caching logic into the repomap generation process.  We will need to introduce a new function to wrap the repomap generating logic.

```rust
// src/server/services/repomap/mod.rs

```

**Reasoning:**

*   `RepoMapService`:  A struct to encapsulate the repomap service, including the cache.
*   `new()`: Constructor to initialize the `RepoMapService`, initializing the cache.
*   `get_repomap()`: The main function providing the cached repomap.
    *   Constructs the `RepoMapCacheKey`.
    *   Checks if the repomap exists in the cache using `cache.get()`.
    *   If found (cache hit), returns the cached repomap - avoids recomputation.
    *   If not found (cache miss):
        *   Calls `generate_repomap()` (the placeholder for your existing repomap generation logic) to produce the `Repomap`.
        *   Creates a `RepoMapCacheValue` containing the generated `Repomap` and the current timestamp.
        *   Inserts this value into the cache via `cache.insert()`.
        *   Returns the generated `Repomap`.
*   `generate_repomap()`: This is a placeholder. Replace this with your existing repomap generation method.

**4. migrations/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_add_repomap_cache.sql**

This migration will be required to store the cached data to the database for production scenarios if you want the caching to survive restarts instead of keeping the cache in memory. The in-memory cache is only suitable for development.

```sql
-- migrations/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_add_repomap_cache.sql
CREATE TABLE repomap_cache (
    repo_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    branch VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    sha VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL, -- SHA-1 is often 40 chars
    repomap TEXT NOT NULL, -- Store the serialized repomap (e.g., JSON)
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    PRIMARY KEY (repo_id, branch, sha)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_repomap_cache_repo_id ON repomap_cache (repo_id);
```

**Reasoning:**

*   `CREATE TABLE repomap_cache`:  Creates a table to store cached repomap entries.
    *   `repo_id`:  References the ID of the repository (foreign key would be ideal, but omitted for brevity).
    *   `branch`:  Stores the branch name.
    *   `sha`:  Stores the commit SHA.  Important to make sure correct length for the data.
    *   `repomap`: Stores the serialized representation of the `Repomap` (e.g., in JSON format). Use `TEXT` as the data type.
    *   `created_at`: Stores the timestamp when the entry was created.
    *   `PRIMARY KEY`:  Ensures uniqueness for each combination of repo, branch, and SHA, and can improve query performance as well.
*   `CREATE INDEX ...`: Creates an index on the `repo_id` column. This will speed up queries that filter by `repo_id`. (Useful for cache invalidation strategies that may delete by repo).

**Summary of Proposed Changes:**

*   **New File:** `src/server/services/repomap/types.rs` - Defines `RepoMapCacheKey`, `RepoMapCacheValue` and `Repomap` structures.
*   **New File:** `src/server/services/repomap/cache.rs` - Implements the in-memory caching logic using a `HashMap` protected by a `Mutex`.
*   **Modified File:** `src/server/services/repomap/mod.rs` - Introduces a `RepoMapService` struct containing the cache, and implements `get_repomap()` which checks the cache, generates the repomap (or retrieves it from the cache), and stores the generated repomap in the cache. This also adds a placeholder for original `generate_repomap` logic.
*   **New File:** `migrations/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_add_repomap_cache.sql` - Creates the SQL schema for database-backed caching (optional).

This implementation provides a foundation for caching repomaps by branch and SHA. Remember to adapt the placeholder `Repomap` type and the `generate_repomap` function to your existing code.  Also, the in-memory cache is suitable for local development, but in a production context, integrating this cache with a more robust caching solution like Redis, Memcached, or writing to the database via the migrations is greatly encouraged.

=== COMPLETE RAW RESPONSE ===
Okay, let's break down the implementation of this repomap caching feature. We'll create the necessary files and populate them with the code required to cache repomaps based on branch and commit SHA.

**1. src/server/services/repomap/types.rs**

This file defines the data structures involved in the repomap system. We'll need a structure to represent the cached repomap and probably some related types.

```rust
// src/server/services/repomap/types.rs
use crate::model::repo::RepoId;
use chrono::{DateTime, Utc};

#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq)]
pub struct RepoMapCacheKey {
    pub repo_id: RepoId,
    pub branch: String,
    pub sha: String,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq)]
pub struct RepoMapCacheValue {
    pub repomap: Repomap, // Assuming Repomap is defined elsewhere
    pub created_at: DateTime<Utc>,
}


// Placeholder - replace with your actual Repomap type definition
#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq)]
pub struct Repomap {
    pub content: String, // Or whatever your repomap data structure holds
}

```

**Reasoning:**

*   `RepoMapCacheKey`: This struct defines the cache key, crucial for identifying cached repomaps. It includes `repo_id` to identify the repository itself, `branch` to specify the branch, and `sha` to represent the commit SHA.  This combination ensures cache uniqueness per repo, branch and commit.
*   `RepoMapCacheValue`: This struct holds the actual cached data - the `Repomap` itself and timestamp of creation.
*   `Repomap`:Placeholder for your repomap structure to be concrete.

**2. src/server/services/repomap/cache.rs**

This file will hold the cache implementation itself.  We'll use a simple in-memory cache for this example, but this could be adapted to use a more sophisticated caching solution like Redis or Memcached in production.

```rust
// src/server/services/repomap/cache.rs
use crate::server::services::repomap::types::{RepoMapCacheKey, RepoMapCacheValue};
use std::collections::HashMap;
use std::sync::Mutex; // Or a more concurrent-friendly structure could be used

pub struct RepoMapCache {
    cache: Mutex<HashMap<RepoMapCacheKey, RepoMapCacheValue>>,
}

impl RepoMapCache {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        RepoMapCache {
            cache: Mutex::new(HashMap::new()),
        }
    }

    pub fn get(&self, key: &RepoMapCacheKey) -> Option<RepoMapCacheValue> {
        let cache = self.cache.lock().unwrap(); // Handle potential mutex poisoning
        cache.get(key).cloned()
    }

    pub fn insert(&self, key: RepoMapCacheKey, value: RepoMapCacheValue) {
        let mut cache = self.cache.lock().unwrap();
        cache.insert(key, value);
    }

    pub fn remove(&self, key: &RepoMapCacheKey) {
        let mut cache = self.cache.lock().unwrap();
        cache.remove(key);
    }


    pub fn clear(&self) {
        let mut cache = self.cache.lock().unwrap();
        cache.clear();
    }
}

```

**Reasoning:**

*   `RepoMapCache`: This struct holds the actual cache, a `HashMap` protected by a `Mutex`. The `Mutex` makes the cache thread-safe.
*   `new()`:  Constructor to initialize an empty cache.
*   `get()`: Retrieves a `RepoMapCacheValue` from the cache based on the provided `RepoMapCacheKey`.  Clones the value to avoid holding the lock for too long.
*   `insert()`: Inserts a new `RepoMapCacheValue` into the cache with the given `RepoMapCacheKey`.
*   `remove()`: Removes a cached entry
*   `clear()`: Clears the cache entirely.  Useful for maintenance or invalidation.

**3. src/server/services/repomap/mod.rs**

This is where we'll integrate the caching logic into the repomap generation process.  We will need to introduce a new function to wrap the repomap generating logic.

```rust
// src/server/services/repomap/mod.rs
use crate::server::services::repomap::cache::RepoMapCache;
use crate::server::services::repomap::types::{RepoMapCacheKey, RepoMapCacheValue, Repomap};
use crate::model::repo::RepoId;
use chrono::Utc;

pub struct RepoMapService {
    cache: RepoMapCache,
    // Other dependencies, such as the database connection, etc.
}

impl RepoMapService {
    pub fn new() -> Self {
        RepoMapService {
            cache: RepoMapCache::new(),
        }
    }

    pub fn get_repomap(
        &self,
        repo_id: RepoId,
        branch: &str,
        sha: &str,
    ) -> Result<Repomap, String> {
        let key = RepoMapCacheKey {
            repo_id,
            branch: branch.to_string(),
            sha: sha.to_string(),
        };

        // 1. Check the cache
        if let Some(cached_value) = self.cache.get(&key) {
            println!("Repomap cache hit for repo_id: {:?}, branch: {}, sha: {}",repo_id, branch, sha);
            return Ok(cached_value.repomap);
        }
        println!("Repomap cache miss for repo_id: {:?}, branch: {}, sha: {}",repo_id, branch, sha);

        // 2. Generate the repomap (replace with your actual logic)
        let repomap = self.generate_repomap(repo_id, branch, sha)?; // Replace with actual logic

        // 3. Store in the cache
        let cache_value = RepoMapCacheValue {
            repomap: repomap.clone(),
            created_at: Utc::now(),
        };
        self.cache.insert(key, cache_value);

        Ok(repomap)
    }

    // Placeholder for your actual repomap generation logic
    fn generate_repomap(
        &self,
        repo_id: RepoId,
        branch: &str,
        sha: &str,
    ) -> Result<Repomap, String> {
        // Simulate repomap generation (replace with your implementation)
        println!("Generating repomap for repo_id: {:?}, branch: {}, sha: {}", repo_id, branch, sha);
        let content = format!(
            "RepoMap for repo_id: {:?}, branch: {}, sha: {}",
            repo_id, branch, sha
        );
        Ok(Repomap { content })
    }
}

```

**Reasoning:**

*   `RepoMapService`:  A struct to encapsulate the repomap service, including the cache.
*   `new()`: Constructor to initialize the `RepoMapService`, initializing the cache.
*   `get_repomap()`: The main function providing the cached repomap.

        *   Creates a `RepoMapCacheValue` containing the generated `Repomap` and the current timestamp.
        *   Inserts this value into the cache via `cache.insert()`.
        *   Returns the generated `Repomap`.
*   `generate_repomap()`: This is a placeholder. Replace this with your existing repomap generation method.

    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    PRIMARY KEY (repo_id, branch, sha)
);

CREATE INDEX idx_repomap_cache_repo_id ON repomap_cache (repo_id);
```

**Reasoning:**

*   `CREATE TABLE repomap_cache`:  Creates a table to store cached repomap entries.
    *   `repo_id`:  References the ID of the repository (foreign key would be ideal, but omitted for brevity).

so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's request based on the analysis provided. The user has shared an analysis that outlines changes to several Rust files and a migration script. They want specific Rust code changes for the files mentioned.\n\nLooking at the analysis, there are four main parts:\n\n1. **types.rs**: A new file that defines structs for cache keys, values, and the Repomap.\n2. **cache.rs**: Another new file implementing an in-memory cache using a HashMap and Mutex.\n3. **mod.rs**: Modifications to integrate the cache into the service, adding a RepoMapService.\n4. **migration script**: A SQL file to create a table for persistent caching.\n\nThe user's instruction is to generate specific Rust code changes following the schema exactly. Since I'm to describe the thinking process, I should simulate how someone would approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to recognize that the user provided the exact code that should be in each file. They are asking for the code changes, so the response should include creating or updating these files with the given code.\n\nI should also consider that the analysis includes placeholders, like the Repomap struct, which the user needs to replace with their actual implementation. But since the user provided the code, I can present it as-is.\n\nI should note that each file is either new or modified. For types.rs, cache.rs, and mod.rs, the code is provided, so I can directly include them in the response. The migration script is also provided, so I can include it as a new file.\n\nI need to organize the response by each file, indicating whether it's a new file or a modification, and then present the code exactly as given in the analysis. I should make sure to highlight that the Repomap struct is a placeholder and needs to be replaced.\n\nAdditionally, the response should mention that these changes provide a basic caching system, with the note that for production, a more robust solution like Redis might be better.\n\nSo, the next step is to present each file's code, clearly labeled, and provide the necessary explanations as per the analysis.\nHere are the specific Rust code changes and migration script based on the provided analysis:\n\n1. **src/server/services/repomap/types.rs**\n```rust\n// src/server/services/repomap/types.rs\nuse crate::model::repo::RepoId;\nuse chrono::{DateTime, Utc};\n\n#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq, Eq)]\npub struct RepoMapCacheKey {\n    pub repo_id: RepoId,\n    pub branch: String,\n    pub sha: String,\n}\n\n#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq)]\npub struct RepoMapCacheValue {\n    pub repomap: Repomap,\n    pub created_at: DateTime<Utc>,\n}\n\n#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq)]\npub struct Repomap {\n    pub content: String,\n}\n```\n\n2. **src/server/services/repomap/cache.rs**\n```rust\n// src/server/services/repomap/cache.rs\nuse crate::server::services::repomap::types::{RepoMapCacheKey, RepoMapCacheValue};\nuse std::collections::HashMap;\nuse std::sync::Mutex;\n\npub struct RepoMapCache {\n    cache: Mutex<HashMap<RepoMapCacheKey, RepoMapCacheValue>>,\n}\n\nimpl RepoMapCache {\n    pub fn new() -> Self {\n        RepoMapCache {\n            cache: Mutex::new(HashMap::new()),\n        }\n    }\n\n    pub fn get(&self, key: &RepoMapCacheKey) -> Option<RepoMapCacheValue> {\n        let cache = self.cache.lock().unwrap();\n        cache.get(key).cloned()\n    }\n\n    pub fn insert(&self, key: RepoMapCacheKey, value: RepoMapCacheValue) {\n        let mut cache = self.cache.lock().unwrap();\n        cache.insert(key, value);\n    }\n\n    pub fn remove(&self, key: &RepoMapCacheKey) {\n        let mut cache = self.cache.lock().unwrap();\n        cache.remove(key);\n    }\n\n    pub fn clear(&self) {\n        let mut cache = self.cache.lock().unwrap();\n        cache.clear();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n3. **src/server/services/repomap/mod.rs**\n```rust\n// src/server/services/repomap/mod.rs\nuse crate::server::services::repomap::cache::RepoMapCache;\nuse crate::server::services::repomap::types::{RepoMapCacheKey, RepoMapCacheValue, Repomap};\nuse crate::model::repo::RepoId;\nuse chrono::Utc;\n\npub struct RepoMapService {\n    cache: RepoMapCache,\n}\n\nimpl RepoMapService {\n    pub fn new() -> Self {\n        RepoMapService {\n            cache: RepoMapCache::new(),\n        }\n    }\n\n    pub fn get_repomap(\n        &self,\n        repo_id: RepoId,\n        branch: &str,\n        sha: &str,\n    ) -> Result<Repomap, String> {\n        let key = RepoMapCacheKey {\n            repo_id,\n            branch: branch.to_string(),\n            sha: sha.to_string(),\n        };\n\n        if let Some(cached_value) = self.cache.get(&key) {\n            println!(\"Repomap cache hit: repo_id={:?}, branch={}, sha={}\", repo_id, branch, sha);\n            return Ok(cached_value.repomap);\n        }\n\n        println!(\"Repomap cache miss: repo_id={:?}, branch={}, sha={}\", repo_id, branch, sha);\n        \n        let repomap = self.generate_repomap(repo_id, branch, sha)?;\n\n        let cache_value = RepoMapCacheValue {\n            repomap: repomap.clone(),\n            created_at: Utc::now(),\n        };\n        self.cache.insert(key, cache_value);\n\n        Ok(repomap)\n    }\n\n    fn generate_repomap(\n        &self,\n        repo_id: RepoId,\n        branch: &str,\n        sha: &str,\n    ) -> Result<Repomap, String> {\n        // This is where you would implement your actual repomap generation logic\n        // The following is just a placeholder implementation\n        let content = format!(\n            \"RepoMap for repo_id: {:?}, branch: {}, sha: {}\",\n            repo_id, branch, sha\n        );\n        Ok(Repomap { content })\n    }\n}\n```\n\n4. **migrations/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_add_repomap_cache.sql** (Note: Replace YYYYMMDDHHMMSS with the appropriate timestamp)\n```sql\n-- migrations/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_add_repomap_cache.sql\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS repomap_cache (\n    repo_id BIGINT NOT NULL,\n    branch VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n    sha VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL,\n    repomap TEXT NOT NULL,\n    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),\n    PRIMARY KEY (repo_id, branch, sha)\n);\n\nCREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_repomap_cache_repo_id\nON repomap_cache (repo_id);\n```\n\nThese changes implement an in-memory caching system for repomaps. The `Repomap` struct is currently a placeholder and should be replaced with your actual repomap data structure. The `generate_repomap` function should be updated with your actual repomap generation logic.\n\nFor a production environment, consider using a more robust caching solution like Redis or implementing database-backed caching using the provided migration script.","refusal":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":2326,"completion_tokens":1511,"total_tokens":3837}}

## User interface design for artificial intelligence

A set of design principles and assets for AI applications by [Oliver Rozynski](https://www.startsomething.io)

### Index of Features

- **People**: These are the people included in your current chat. Adding multiple people to a chat allows for a shared discussion.

- **Canvas**: This mode displays an interactive canvas for a chat, providing and collaborative drag-and-drop interface for navigating a conversation visually.

- **Alignment**: Receive personal suggestions to connect with ideas and people by allowing AI to seek understanding of who you are and align with you.

- **Agents**: These are the agents included in your current chat. You can include multiple models or a number of defined specialisations.

- **Art Generation**: Create an image from a prompt. This function is know as text-to-image and allows the user to create any image they can describe with words.

- **Input**: Inputs could be Voice, Vision, Text or uploaded Files such as an image, screenshot or a PDF which you would like you AI to comment on.

- **Suggestions**: Allow AI to prompt-serve you with contextual topics and ideas towards your goals and encourage deeper understanding and awareness.

- **Video Generation**: Create a video from a prompt or an image. This function is known as text-to-video or image-to-video and allows the user to create coherent moving imagery.

- **Output**: Outputs could be Voice, Text, Image, Video, or Avatar and eventually will include full device and services control or the control of a real-world robot.

- **Perspectives**: This mode allows multiple perspectives on a topic and functions like a multi-agent model by allowing your prompts to be considered by many different view-points.

- **Vision**: Let AI see through your device camera and respond to your environment. This is useful when you want your AI model to understand or describe a real-world event.

- **Connections**: Allow AI to connect you with other people with mutual goals, such as people who are professionally hiring in your field or simply people who share your interests.

- **Timeline**: This mode shows your interaction history for a chat, allowing for you to see an overview of both your and your model's input and conversational pathways.

- **Voice**: This mode allows for you to speak in natural language to your AI model through you device microphone, and/or have your AI speak to you using your device speaker.

- **Functions**: Features of your AI model, such as Art Generation, Video Generation or Vision. These functions go beyond a standard chat interface by providing additional value.

- **Chat**: You can start another chat window. This will reset values such as included people, agents and immediate goals for this chat window.

- **Memory**: Manage what your AI agent remembers about you. This can be things you have said in previous chats or things that you have explicitly asked be remembered.

- **Modes**: This defines the interaction interfaces you can have with your agent, such as an avatar which speaks to you, or visual UI like a canvas or structured timeline.

- **Prompts**: This represents a message that you have written to your AI model, or a response or question that your AI has sent to you within a chat.

- **Avatar**: This mode provides a character and voice interface and allows for a more natural spoken interaction and the ability to see your AI model visually react in real-time.

- **Configure**: Adjust your preferences. This is where you will find your memory settings, personal preferences and account details and the configuration of your AI's avatar.

- **Goals**: You can set both immediate and long term goals. This allows for a meaningful alignment with your intention and ambition contextually.

- **Text**: This mode provides a text input for its interface and is the most commonly used user interface for interacting with AI agents.

- **Files**: Uploading an image, screenshot or a PDF which you would like you AI to comment on allows for the analysis of large amounts of data or un-digitised artifacts.

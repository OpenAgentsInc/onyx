00:00 We'll get back to the Onyx app stuff tomorrow. Today, I wanted to review this new open-source physics engine. It seems like the most exciting open-source AI release in a long time.

00:12 I saw this tweet on my feed. One of the authors mentioned that there were times they felt this simulator might be too advanced to release. They’ve now open-sourced a new generative physics engine project.

00:23 We're going to watch their three-minute video together. Before that, some introductory tweets: Over 20 labs worked together to open-source "Genesis," a physics engine with a vision-language model (VLM) agent that turns text prompts into interactive 4D worlds. Think instant, physics-accurate environments, camera paths, and character animations all from natural language.

00:48 It turns natural language prompts into fully simulated environments, tasks, motions, and even policies. Robotics and embodied AI just got a serious upgrade.

00:55 Imagine training AI agents, testing robots, or creating entire virtual worlds much faster. It's 100% Python, fully open source, and built for everyone. The barrier to entry is gone.

01:07 I want to understand how this could intersect with open agents in the future, maybe even with Onyx. We’ll see how it might fit with the data marketplace idea we talked about in the last video. Does it intersect with embodied AI, robotics, virtual worlds, and all this physics fun stuff?

01:23 Let’s try to make sense of this. We'll use the Open Agents Pro Dashboard soon to ask questions of the README and the codebase—just to get up to speed with what Genesis is all about. Then we might throw it into Open Agents in Onyx docs and speculate about intersections with the marketplace concept.

01:50 We discussed a data marketplace before. How might this tie in? Robotics, virtual worlds, physics simulations... I’m looking for an excuse to dig into the latest fun stuff. Let’s watch the video now.

02:13 Starting the video... (Watching silently)

04:46 Eventually, these could be robot brains. We’re not going to remain software-only and non-embodied forever. We'll want robot brains that are open source.

05:02 A fully open-sourced physics engine… This feels like one of those stealth projects that would drop a glossy marketing video to announce a $30 million raise. But nope—here's the GitHub repo. Just open-sourced.

05:50 Let's check out the GitHub repo now.

06:05 I’ll summarize the Genesis README in three paragraphs: Genesis is a comprehensive physics platform designed for robotics, embodied AI, and other physical AI applications. At its core, it combines a universal physics engine built from scratch, a lightweight and fast robotics simulation platform, and a photorealistic rendering system.

06:31 It also includes a generative data engine that can transform natural language prompts into a variety of data types. The system boasts impressive capabilities, including unprecedented simulation speeds (43 million FPS?), cross-platform compatibility, and support for various physics solvers and materials. It handles rigid bodies, liquids, gases, deformable objects, and supports a wide range of robots: arms, legged robots, drones, and soft robots. It’s fully differentiable and includes physics-based tactile sensors.

07:28 Genesis is built with three long-term missions in mind: making physics simulation more accessible, unifying various state-of-the-art physics solvers, and minimizing human effort in data collection for robotics. It’s Apache 2 licensed and welcomes community contributions. This is impressive.

08:12 They open-sourced a huge portion of it. The author’s post mentions a two-year large-scale collaboration across 20 labs. It's a generative physics engine that can create 4D dynamical worlds, powered by a simulation platform 10-80 times faster than existing GPU-accelerated stacks. It can simulate 430,000 times faster than real-time, and training a robotic locomotion policy takes only 26 seconds on a single RTX 4090. The open-source code is available now, and they’ll roll out more generative frameworks soon.

09:59 This might be analogous to how Midjourney built productized versions of stable diffusion. Perhaps Open Agents could do something similar with Genesis. Genesis aims to unify simulation frameworks into a single environment with high realism. They want a universal data engine that can autonomously create physical worlds and generate diverse data types—environments, camera motions, robotic tasks, reward functions, policies, character motions, etc. Fully interactive 3D scenes, open-world articulated assets, and more are possible.

11:04 They just dropped it on GitHub. This is truly open AI. A massive collaboration with 20 labs. I hope they succeed, and I hope we can do something interesting with Open Agents. Maybe we have a unique angle.

11:36 Let’s explore if Open Agents and Onyx can integrate with this technology. Could Genesis be a physics validation service in the Onyx data marketplace? Simulate scenarios and environments for training or validating AI models, robotics tasks, etc.

17:52 With Genesis, Onyx, and Open Agents, we could create an interactive physics-aware AI assistant for 3D design, robotics programming, testing, analysis, and real-time physics simulations. We could even create synthetic training data for anomaly detection and run simulations as a service.

19:31 Let’s write a “Genesis.md” doc on the Onyx repo about potential integration: Genesis can serve as a physics-based validation and generation engine. It can validate drone footage against real physics, create synthetic training data, and integrate as a paid service via Onyx. Robots, data validation, simulation as a service, knowledge graph enhancements... all sorts of possibilities.

22:10 On another tangent: drones. Hostile drones are flying around. Why not create a defensive drone fleet and use Genesis simulations to train interception strategies? Post bounties for custom robot simulations. This could be a whole new line of defense, simulation, and training service.

25:45 Using Genesis and Onyx, we could design a defensive drone fleet system—train them in simulation, then deploy. Payment models could be micropayments for successful interception tasks, all handled through Open Agents and Onyx. Physics-driven data generation, scenario testing, and real-time adjustments to drone tactics.

30:05 Summarizing: Genesis is an ultra-fast, open-source, universal physics simulation engine capable of generating complex 4D worlds from text prompts. Integrating it with Open Agents and Onyx could revolutionize data validation, robotics training, and complex scenario simulation. Whether it's for industrial robotics, drone defense, healthcare assistance, or education, the combined ecosystem could enable a marketplace of evolving AI functionalities, paid per use and rapidly improving over time.

SPEAKER_00 (00:00 - 00:28): Happy Monday. Welcome to the last week of 12 nights of open agents. We're going to be responding directly to the release of open AI today search Because we really want to search for answers to what's going on with this drone situation I see it all over my x-feed no one seems to know what's going on This seems to be where AI assisted sense making should help like what is the answer?
SPEAKER_00 (00:29 - 01:03): So what we're going to do is look at what open AI and Proplexity and GROC all have to say about the drone situation see if we're satisfied by the answers and Try by the end of tonight to have some little open agents mini project give better answers We think about what these things actually are Yeah, so I'm going to kind of chop this up right now. It's 204 p.m. Central time and we'll kind of skip ahead
SPEAKER_00 (01:03 - 01:39): But let's start with a little intro here. So I guess open AI has already had search working But they just made it available to free users anyway. Let's try it. I have been trying it. I installed the Chrome extension so that replaced my default search so who is operating the recent drone unidentified drones in New Jersey and other states All right since mid-November
SPEAKER_00 (01:40 - 02:11): New more sightings of another identified drones have been reported across New Jersey and other states including New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland these drones are often described as large with some estimates suggesting diameters up to six feet and have been observed operating during nighttime hours Despite extensive investigations by federal and state authorities the operators and origins of these drones remain unknown The FBI DHS and FAA are actively investigating these incidents a joint statement from DHS and the FBI indicated that many reported sightings might be
SPEAKER_00 (02:12 - 02:44): misidentified manned aircraft operating lawfully They emphasize that there is currently no evidence suggesting these drones pose a threat to national security or public safety Okay, that sounds like a fucking lie and you know, it'll be fun through this process to like Collect the evidence that you might see floating around X or something someone said and like put it in a place where we can actually verify and Check these statements from officials However, some local officials and residents remain concerned New Jersey assemblywoman John Fantasia after a briefing with DHS reported that the drones operate in a
SPEAKER_00 (02:44 - 03:15): Coordinated manner sometimes flying with their lights off and do not appear to be flown by hobbyists Additionally, there have been calls for more transparency and action from federal authorities For instance, former president Donald Trump suggested that the military should intervene to address the drones Despite these concerns, the Pentagon has stated that there is no evidence linking the drones to foreign adversaries They've also noted that many of the sightings could be misidentified manned aircraft In summary, while the recent drone sightings in New Jersey and other states have garnered significant attention and concern the identities of the operators and the air Tensions remain undetermined
SPEAKER_00 (03:16 - 03:48): Investigations are ongoing and authorities continue to monitor the situation closely Okay, so I've had a little bit of conversations with perplexity and such One of the things that I said, let's do this one first Giving the three most likely scenarios Based on all the available information about the drones where they're from who's piloting them and why Misidentification of manned aircraft Many reported drones that yeah
SPEAKER_00 (03:49 - 04:26): Several sightings are likely conventional aircraft obviously there's going to be some false positive But this does not answer the question what the ones that are legit Actually are increased drone activity due to regulatory changes For surveillance operations Okay, so I also asked Chad GPT-01 Pro which I'm assuming has searched stuff I said who's operating the drones flying around New Jersey in other states in December 24 24. I just like Kavanaugh
SPEAKER_00 (04:26 - 04:47): As of mid-December, there is no widely confirmed single source responsible for all drones observed flying around New Jersey It could be a bunch of these I was like This is just like what be pooled easy. I was like I'm referencing the recent headlines about mysterious drones Are you aware of those headlines or is that a generic response?
SPEAKER_00 (04:47 - 05:18): What are the main theories about the purpose of these drones that are appearing above sensitive areas government officials houses etc I'm aware that in late 2024 a number of media outlets and local communities have reported sightings of unusual Unclaimed drone activity particularly around sensitive areas critical infrastructure Hyper-file officials residences and even certain military facilities while details remain sparse the combination of sustained presence apparent coordination and flight patterns That suggests deliberate reconnaissance have led to intense speculation since no apparent
SPEAKER_00 (05:18 - 05:48): Since no single group work individuals openly claim responsibility the purpose remains to subjective debate the leading theories include foreign state surveillance industrial or corporate espionage Domestic activism or extremism Criminal surveillance and smuggling hobbyist pranksters are drone tourism grey zone tactics. Okay, here's let's like a list of theories interesting. They don't mention the government usage
SPEAKER_00 (05:48 - 06:19): To give me the most three most likely scenarios Foreign state-sponsored surveillance Over and hours associated with the foreign government or its intelligence hers like Domestic extremist or militant groups organized corporate or criminal espionage Okay, so I want to like Assess the likelihood of these different things based on information because like as I'm reading these I'm just like thinking about well. I saw that one post on X that like seems to make certain of these things conflict
SPEAKER_00 (06:19 - 06:41): And I just don't know what all is going into this response. Can I even look and see? Maybe they're just about it doesn't have search integrated Officials downplay, but let's see if these search things are like waiting recent headlines by just like what's at the top of their like like what algorithm are they using?
SPEAKER_00 (06:44 - 06:57): Okay, so now this is something that perplexity I wanted to try perplexity because they build themselves as like the answer engine You ask them a question you get an answer So I started a chat with them 42 minutes ago is it who's operating the drones?
SPEAKER_00 (06:57 - 07:16): The identity remains unknown Despite ongoing investigations federal and state authorities have not been able to determine who is responsible for these drone flights He points no evidence of a foreign nexus Don't appear to pose a threat. So what are the main theories?
SPEAKER_00 (07:18 - 07:49): Environmental monitoring Gas leaks are ready exercises foreign surveillance Military government operations This is just like a listing of theories. I said give me the three was likely scenarios. Now look at this Perplexity suggests that one of the three most likely scenarios is a government surveillance operation The drones can be part of a covert government surveillance program the commercial grade equipment coordinated flight patterns and ability to evade detection
SPEAKER_00 (07:49 - 08:22): Suggest is sophisticated operation The proximity to critical infrastructure military sites and high profile locations Like trubs golf course and bedminster supports this theory the lack of transparency from federal agencies And their insistence that the drones pose no threat to national security further fuels his possibility And then for instance intelligence foreign intelligence gathering and then private sector map here surveying My bet is that it'd be pretty easy to rule out number three here and number one seems to dramatically conflict with
SPEAKER_00 (08:22 - 08:58): this article That I paste it in here So my orc as the Department of Homeland Homeland Security secretary wants State and local authorities to have the ability to counter drone activity. It says specifically like shoot them down Give states the power to shoot down drones says homeland security secretary I said if it was number one if it's the government surveillance operation Wouldn't the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security be aware of that and so not be asking to like shoot them down
SPEAKER_00 (09:05 - 09:37): US on the security secretary has said states need the power to shoot down drones So answer your analysis raises valid point if the drone activity were indeed a government surveillance operation the number one scenario It would be unusual for the head of the Department of Homeland Security to publicly request additional powers to counter these drones I mean less than just like a naked power grab Which you know the governments do that
SPEAKER_00 (09:38 - 10:11): but So my orc is this call for states to have the power to shoot down drones under federal supervision indicates that The federal government including dhs may not have full control or knowledge of the drone operations That's scary by itself. There's a genuine concern about unauthorized drone activity that current federal capabilities cannot adequately address The situation is complex enough that federal agencies alone cannot manage it effectively Are there supposed to be defending this fucking country? What the fuck are they doing
SPEAKER_00 (10:11 - 10:45): Locking down Ukraine airspace fucking fucks This new information shifts the likelihood towards the other two scenarios Foreign intelligence gathering private sector or unauthorized domestic activity. Okay, so this is a little problematic If I ask perplexity which is supposed to have the entire fucking internet and all the recent stuff indexed properly to give me good answers says that the number one response is Is now no longer the number one response because of an article where I'm like, well, that does kind of conflicts with this
SPEAKER_00 (10:46 - 11:18): That's just one article that I saw So I got no satisfactory answers from any of this stuff and then you know, I had kind of a similar experience with rock like Yeah, it might be government military testing like uh but maybe Oh, if the drones were operated, you know, yeah my orchestra probably would be aware of that So but maybe here's some other reasons and this is just kind of like a
SPEAKER_00 (11:21 - 11:53): Yeah, three most likely scenarios like oh US government or military testing and surveillance maybe We don't know we don't know Well, we need now is a knowledge graph Uh I've had Paul said uh Yeah, the biggest challenge with LM is the lack of memory Grok leverages all of x as its memory bank, but posts are a chaotic and unreliable source of ground truth open-source knowledge graphs provides the solution. Yeah
SPEAKER_00 (11:54 - 12:24): Yeah So we've done some um work on graphs earlier in the series graph rag um Yeah, I just think um Okay, so the basics of graph rag is instead of just doing retrieval augmented generation over like Data by cosine similar similarity to find stuff that's semantically similar
SPEAKER_00 (12:27 - 12:57): Given that as The corpus of data gets larger or the quality of responses goes down But microsoft research had this paper about graph rag like hey if you organize things in these kind of semantic categories and have different summaries at different levels Increases the ability for things to be retrieved accurately um Organizing data as nodes and edges so basically what I want
SPEAKER_00 (12:58 - 13:18): Is to take certain pieces of data that come across my feet that seem relevant That like should be factored in like for example Senator Schumer saying We don't believe their US military drones or the military would have told us that like that's a data point Do these other Search things use that as a data point. I don't know
SPEAKER_01 (13:24 - 13:27): Ooh
SPEAKER_00 (13:27 - 13:58): Yeah, this is interesting so when I said give me the three most likely scenarios Look at this One of the three posts that grok used in its analysis Is there because it used the phrase likely scenario so that's just doing a cosine similarity search over what I said Oh, you want the most likely scenarios that that that drones Here's the most likely scenario that that that drones But no, this is a post from some anon
SPEAKER_00 (14:00 - 14:34): Quoteweeting this tiktok that went viral from John Ferguson That I've separately seen other people in my feed that are more reputable being like well That's actually not right they wouldn't be looking for nuclear because there's this other program that has this it's like This is not the best piece of information but given the Unsophisticated search algorithm that you could tell what they're using It's services as the most relevant but it's not not to the query that I'm asking for What is the truth? Sorry grok you're not maximally truth-seeking in this
SPEAKER_00 (14:35 - 15:07): In this case and I want to try to build something that's more truth-seeking than you in the next 12 hours Ah two of these from the same thing. Okay, so that up but this this guy's thing should be a data point I want to be able to do is feed this stuff into a knowledge base a knowledge graph that's searchable That other people who also can add to Let's get started. I'm gonna do this in a fresh
(15:08 - 15:09): app
SPEAKER_00 (15:09 - 15:18): For I'm gonna make a fresh app and I'll just show you guys How I whip up stuff. So let's just do it
SPEAKER_00 (15:29 - 15:43): What should I call this drone Sense maker what the drone what the drone What the drone
SPEAKER_00 (16:09 - 16:40): Okay, I'm gonna create a new project. I'm gonna call this what the drone And I'll say um we are building a uh cross-platform Android iOS web app via ragnative expo to um
SPEAKER_00 (16:41 - 17:12): Help make sense of the recent drone sightings Want people to be able to search over a publicly visible editable knowledge graph of recent activity drones
SPEAKER_00 (17:12 - 17:48): relevance Sponsors Okay So here's what I'm gonna do app factory oh here mobile apps
SPEAKER_00 (17:48 - 18:04): mpx create expo app latest What's wrong?
SPEAKER_00 (18:04 - 18:35): Yeah, yeah I see these people making like a million dollars a month from fucking Callie i like gpt wrapper apps Because they just found some like shit experience and they made an AI power version of it that with it ip and like Yeah, yeah The cost of creating software is approaching zero the time it takes to create software is approaching zero Might as well like create some software that's like simple AI versions of stuff that's out there
SPEAKER_00 (18:35 - 19:06): Just like generate some fucking revenue Yeah, we're doing that Is that done? Yeah, okay, so Okay, so cd with the drone I make the repo yes, I did Is all open source you can copy it. I don't care
SPEAKER_00 (19:07 - 19:45): Bush and I'll do it Project Editor and let's do
SPEAKER_00 (19:57 - 20:36): All right, there's a glorious app and then we also have Whip first I want to spec out the app and the drone main Building it's
SPEAKER_00 (20:38 - 21:07): Highline app factory repo start by reading the read me there and Okay, let's do it Read app factory read me And set up guide summarize here in one paragraph We are streaming this on exo good for you to Tell the audience what we're doing
SPEAKER_00 (21:21 - 21:55): Hey ex We're building a cross-platform app using app factory which is open agents's toolkit for rapidly building mobile apps app factory uses Expo framework to create apps that work on iOS and are in web from a single code base This setup includes typescript expo router for navigation and a comprehensive component library We're using this to build what the drone and app to help make sense of recent drone sightings across the US by creating a publicly visible editable Knowledge graph The app will let people search and contribute to a database of drone sightings and official responses We're following app factories best practices, which include file-based routing custom UI components and platform specific
SPEAKER_00 (22:04 - 22:51): Take a look at what the drone Pository Look at all the files and put in docs slash hierarchy.md of that repo a file folder diagram Of everything we have It's simple
SPEAKER_00 (22:51 - 23:06): So when I start a project I like having a everything in one file When I help if I start a new conversation I can help that It's be okay, so we have docs hierarchy
SPEAKER_00 (23:21 - 23:54): craft itself to be in bjs rafrag So let's write a spec Now write a docs spec.md
SPEAKER_00 (23:57 - 24:30): When you think we have enough detail here for a comprehensive spec and to-do list Start by asking me any questions needed Start with this implementing basic version of rafrag having pieces of info
SPEAKER_00 (24:33 - 25:10): represented as nodes with edges between them and different summaries tags for categorization and tailed semantic searching Any given piece of content like a transcript of a video We need to store the raw content links
SPEAKER_00 (25:11 - 25:47): metadata time author source etc as well as a semantic entity extraction as well as results from a semantic entity extraction according to graph rag algorithm each entity being For example a topic like white
SPEAKER_00 (25:47 - 26:25): constrictions which later can be connected with other nodes mentioning same thing um core of the app should enable the user to ask questions about a simulated knowledge and earn
SPEAKER_00 (26:25 - 26:56): kind of points a reward for adding knowledge that gets added to the core We store the graph in a traditional graph database. No, let's just use tql
SPEAKER_00 (27:04 - 27:41): Let's use local expo sqlite Like when user first logs in, they get the tql from some server and Can work with it locally and only later maybe send something up to I paid it vandex search using a specific embedding model provided or should I recommend one ideally something that
SPEAKER_00 (27:41 - 28:12): locally versioning history of the knowledge graph basic version yes any extraction um We define ourselves no We'll use LLMs to extract that from first set of content You should be able to manually add
SPEAKER_00 (28:12 - 28:44): Edit extract entities um in the first version no just read only but later yes ignore for now Ignore for now Ignore for now Yes Should be zoomable Panable Maybe in 3JS Expo 3 etc
SPEAKER_00 (28:45 - 29:16): Um, yes later Yes later authentication system Start with no off API structure Rest Time updates Web socket
SPEAKER_00 (29:16 - 29:27): When relevant Okay, that's enough Write the first spec now Include a to-do list of implementation steps
SPEAKER_00 (30:54 - 31:25): Okay, here's I mean There's that thing posted I paste it in here um
SPEAKER_00 (31:25 - 31:58): Read a new doc vertical slice I want basically a demo MVP seeing a graph of the concepts of one node broken out into categories tags subnodes Starting with this content um
SPEAKER_00 (31:59 - 32:26): Create a new file sources some name.md With this information verbatim then update the spec
(32:26 - 32:28): I
SPEAKER_00 (32:28 - 33:03): mentioned the vertical slice in the vertical slice doc say details about Everything that needs to be done specifically to get the what the drone repo from its current state see what that hierarchy document To the point of being able to interact with initial graph
SPEAKER_00 (33:04 - 33:16): featuring the content from this article I want to see it on my app in five minutes or less go
SPEAKER_00 (33:35 - 34:07): We're setting up the Re canvas I may point it at the onyx repo to see how that sets up at there Say Canvas isn't going to work well on my ios I'm usually just as the camera Maybe we'll wait on the canvas I just get the data show
SPEAKER_00 (34:07 - 34:43): We'll use Goal create a minimum viable demo showing an interactive graph visualization of concepts extracted from our first source article
SPEAKER_00 (34:44 - 35:17): About dhs and drone powers View the graph of concept and if you zoom this visualization Graph view So what I actually may do is um proceed with the three js piece but just pause the video And then Resume once I got something worth Well, it's just kind of a review what it's said here Create essential components initial graph data
SPEAKER_00 (35:19 - 35:52): People my orcas hotel. Oh, this is good Edges. Oh, yeah Oh, yeah, oh, yeah Okay, I'll pause here and Don't not done yet, but I'll stone So I've got the um Lama model 3.2 loaded here
SPEAKER_00 (35:53 - 36:27): Just ran this like basic analysis just using this Kind of simple graph Basically, I fed it a bunch of Had a bunch of source dogs Here transcribers of different Particle scope Steve scotch at the guy So it's um the data quality and you know, you know, where I'm trying to get this work
SPEAKER_00 (36:28 - 37:02): um And then we like loop through with this system prompt where Just from the like initial dumb implementation that my like coding agent recommended Just get like some basic graph based analysis and it's like The model is you click on a node and then it feeds like the node details and the connection details the edges Um, it did this And it says What entities are most connected are their temporal patterns
SPEAKER_00 (37:03 - 37:34): Are their geographic patterns what unusual connections stand out what might this suggest about drone activity Provide your insight in this format insight reasoning confidence Both nodes and so I clicked on I think the node that I like started the analysis from was steward international airport and it gave this analysis The most connected entity appears to be steward international airport with connections about east coast and drone sightings Reasoning blah blah blah blah blah During international airport maybe a key location for drone event
SPEAKER_00 (37:35 - 38:07): But this is only with like me putting in the basic The data around that one node I wanted to consider it holistically so I'm going to refactor this now To not focus just on the individual node eventually I would want to have it like smartly traverse nodes like you do the initial look up to get the most relevant Neighborhood and then let it kind of like traverse between connected information Um So I'm just going to refactor this to maybe not use the graph where you do something different with this Get to some basic holistic
SPEAKER_00 (38:10 - 38:32): Consider all of these things and they kind of like maybe think within it. I don't know This deserves, you know, a few more days of work to like make it pretty But I wanted to see if I can just kind of take a quick cludgy Ugly code path to getting something that would Out from the billion dollar labs

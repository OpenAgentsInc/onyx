Happy Monday. Welcome to the last week of 12 nights of open agents. We’re going to be responding directly to the release of OpenAI’s new search feature, because we really want to search for answers about what’s going on with this drone situation. I see it all over my X-feed and no one seems to know what’s going on. This seems like a perfect scenario where AI-assisted sense-making should help—like, what is the answer?

SPEAKER_00 (00:29 - 01:03)
So what we’re going to do is look at what OpenAI and Perplexity and Grok all have to say about the drone situation, see if we’re satisfied by their answers, and by the end of tonight try to have some little open agents mini-project that can give better answers about what these things actually are. Right now it’s 2:04 p.m. Central time, and we’ll skip ahead, but let’s start with a little intro here. So I guess OpenAI already had search working, but they just made it available to free users. Let’s try it. I’ve been trying it—I installed the Chrome extension so that replaced my default search—“Who is operating the recent unidentified drones in New Jersey and other states since mid-November?”

SPEAKER_00 (01:03 - 01:39)
In mid-November, more sightings of unidentified drones have been reported across New Jersey and other states including New York, Pennsylvania, and Maryland. These drones are often described as large—some estimates suggest diameters up to six feet—and have been observed operating during nighttime hours. Despite extensive investigations by federal and state authorities, the operators and origins of these drones remain unknown. The FBI, DHS, and FAA are actively investigating. A joint statement from DHS and the FBI indicated that many reported sightings might be misidentified manned aircraft operating lawfully. They emphasize that there is currently no evidence suggesting these drones pose a threat to national security or public safety.

SPEAKER_00 (01:40 - 02:11)
Okay, that sounds like a lie, and it’ll be fun through this process to collect evidence that might be floating around X or something someone said, and put it in a place where we can verify it and check these statements from officials. However, some local officials and residents remain concerned. New Jersey Assemblywoman Joan Fantasia, after a briefing with DHS, reported that the drones operate in a coordinated manner, sometimes flying with their lights off, and do not appear to be flown by hobbyists. Additionally, there have been calls for more transparency and action from federal authorities. For instance, former President Donald Trump suggested that the military intervene. Despite these concerns, the Pentagon has stated that there is no evidence linking the drones to foreign adversaries. They’ve noted that many of the sightings could be misidentified manned aircraft. In summary, while the recent drone sightings in New Jersey and other states have garnered significant attention and concern, the identities of the operators and their intentions remain undetermined. Investigations are ongoing and authorities continue to monitor the situation closely.

SPEAKER_00 (02:12 - 02:44)
I’ve had similar conversations with Perplexity and such. Let’s do this: “Give me the three most likely scenarios based on all the available information about the drones—where they’re from, who’s piloting them, and why.” Misidentification of manned aircraft: Many reported drones are likely conventional aircraft. Sure, there will be some false positives, but this doesn’t answer what the legit ones actually are. Increased drone activity due to regulatory changes, and surveillance operations.

SPEAKER_00 (02:44 - 03:15)
I also asked ChatGPT-01 Pro, which I assume has search. I said, “Who’s operating the drones flying around New Jersey and other states in December 2024?” Just as an example. It said as of mid-December there’s no widely confirmed single source responsible for all drones observed. I was like, “This is just like a boilerplate response.” I referenced recent headlines about mysterious drones—are you aware of those headlines or is that a generic response? “What are the main theories about the purpose of these drones appearing above sensitive areas, government officials’ houses, etc.?”

SPEAKER_00 (03:16 - 03:48)
It said it’s aware that in late 2024 there were media outlets and local communities reporting sightings of unusual, unclaimed drone activity, particularly around sensitive areas, critical infrastructure, high-profile officials’ residences, and even certain military facilities. While details remain sparse, the combination of sustained presence, apparent coordination, and flight patterns suggesting deliberate reconnaissance have led to intense speculation. Since no single group or individual claims responsibility, the purpose remains debated. Leading theories include foreign state surveillance, industrial or corporate espionage, domestic activism or extremism, criminal surveillance and smuggling, hobbyist pranksters or drone tourism, and gray zone tactics.

SPEAKER_00 (03:49 - 04:26)
“Give me the three most likely scenarios.” It says foreign state-sponsored surveillance, domestic extremist or militant groups, and corporate or criminal espionage. I want to assess the likelihood of these different things based on information. As I’m reading these, I’m thinking of that one post on X that conflicts with some of these theories, and I just don’t know what the responses are based on. I can’t see what they’re using as a source. Maybe they don’t have search integrated. Officials downplay it. Maybe they’re just pulling from a top-level summary.

SPEAKER_00 (04:26 - 04:47)
Now I tried Perplexity because they brand themselves as an “answer engine.” I asked, “Who is operating the drones?” The identity remains unknown. Federal and state authorities haven’t been able to determine who is responsible. No evidence of a foreign nexus, no threat. So what are the main theories?

SPEAKER_00 (04:47 - 05:18)
Perplexity mentions environmental monitoring, gas leak surveys, training exercises, foreign surveillance, military/government operations. Just a list of theories again. I said, “Give me the three most likely scenarios.” Perplexity suggests one is a government surveillance operation. The drones could be part of a covert government program. Commercial-grade equipment, coordinated flight patterns, ability to evade detection suggests sophistication. Proximity to critical infrastructure, military sites, and high-profile locations (like Trump’s golf course in Bedminster) supports this theory. The lack of transparency from federal agencies and their insistence that drones pose no threat fuels this possibility.

SPEAKER_00 (05:18 - 05:48)
Another scenario is foreign intelligence gathering, and another is private sector mapping or surveying. It’s easy to rule out number three. Number one seems to conflict with the article I pasted in. Mayorkas (DHS Secretary) wants state and local authorities to have the ability to counter drone activity (like shoot them down). If it was a government surveillance operation, wouldn’t he know that and not ask for such powers publicly?

SPEAKER_00 (05:48 - 06:19)
If the drone activity were a government surveillance operation, it would be unusual for the DHS head to ask for additional powers to counter these drones, unless it’s a naked power grab. The call for states to have power to shoot down drones under federal supervision indicates the federal government, including DHS, may not have full control or knowledge of the drone operations. That’s scary. There’s a genuine concern about unauthorized drone activity that current federal capabilities can’t address. That suggests maybe foreign intelligence gathering or private sector activity is more likely.

SPEAKER_00 (06:19 - 06:41)
This is problematic. If I ask Perplexity for likely scenarios, it picks one, and then when I show conflicting evidence, it changes its stance. That’s not great. I got no satisfactory answers from any of these tools. Grok had a similar outcome, just listing generic possibilities. None of them are satisfying.

SPEAKER_00 (06:44 - 06:57)
What we need now is a knowledge graph. I had Paul say that the biggest challenge with LLMs is lack of memory, and that open-source knowledge graphs provide a solution.

SPEAKER_00 (06:57 - 07:16)
We’ve done some work on graphs earlier in the series—GraphRAG. The idea is that instead of just retrieval augmented generation over cosine similarity, we organize data in a semantic graph for better retrieval and more accurate answers.

SPEAKER_00 (07:18 - 07:49)
If we have a large corpus of data, the quality of responses can go down. Microsoft Research mentioned GraphRAG. We can organize data as nodes and edges. For example, we could take certain pieces of data that come across my feed—Senator Schumer saying “We don’t believe they’re US military drones, or the military would’ve told us.” That’s a data point. Are these search tools using that data point? Who knows?

SPEAKER_00 (07:49 - 08:22)
When I asked Grok for the “three most likely scenarios,” it pulled a post from someone on TikTok that might not be reliable. This isn’t maximally truth-seeking. I’d like to build something more truth-seeking in the next 12 hours. It gave me something irrelevant due to the phrase “most likely scenarios.”

SPEAKER_00 (08:22 - 08:58)
So the plan: build a knowledge base or knowledge graph that’s searchable and that other people can add to. Let’s get started. I’m going to do this in a fresh app. I’ll just show you how I set this up. Let’s call it “WhatTheDrone.” We’ll build a cross-platform app using Expo and React Native, and let people search and contribute to a publicly visible, editable knowledge graph of recent drone sightings. We’ll store the graph, let people ask questions, and have some reward points for adding knowledge.

SPEAKER_00 (08:58 - 10:11)
We won’t do a graph database right now, maybe just SQLite locally. We’ll do some semantic entity extraction using LLMs. Let’s start building something in a separate repo. We can show the code and get some basic GraphRAG working. The goal is a minimal viable product by tomorrow, then iterate with user feedback. Let’s get some Bitcoin flowing once we tie in incentives. See you soon.

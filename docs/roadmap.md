## Development Philosophy

This roadmap prioritizes building a solid foundation first with voice capabilities, Bitcoin integration, and knowledge graph infrastructure. The marketplace and agent capabilities are built on this foundation, followed by advanced features and optimizations.

Each phase builds upon previous work while maintaining focus on core value propositions:
- Knowledge sharing and validation
- Bitcoin-based incentives and rewards
- Advanced agent capabilities
- Physics-based validation and simulation

The timeline is aggressive but achievable with focused development and proper resource allocation. Regular reviews and adjustments will be made based on progress and user feedback.
